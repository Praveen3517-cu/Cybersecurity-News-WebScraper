"From job promise to forced fraud: Indians speak out on harrowing ordealMar 22, 2025, 18:23 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Hyderabad: Several Indian youths recently repatriated from Myanmar, where they were trapped in cybercrime centres, are now calling for urgent action against the expansive agent network responsible for their exploitation.
These agents, operating across various parts of India—including Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, North Telangana, and North Andhra—lure unsuspecting individuals with promises of high-paying jobs abroad. Some agents are also based in Delhi, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, and other states.
Authorities, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB), have started gathering information about these agents, who reportedly facilitated the victims' journey to Myanmar through Thailand. In a chilling twist, some victims—having endured the torment themselves—became agents, recruiting others in exchange for commissions. Additionally, social media ads promoting overseas job opportunities have lured many victims into this trap.
The CBI and TGCSB have been meticulously documenting statements from the victims, who have been provided with a detailed questionnaire containing 25 questions about their personal details, travel routes, and harrowing experiences in the cybercrime centres. The victims are being asked to recount how they were recruited, the nature of their forced work, and the abuse they endured. To aid the investigation, the agencies have also collected photos and videos as evidence.
Kalyan Putcha, a victim from Palasa, shared his harrowing story: ""I was enrolled in a flight attendant course when a friend introduced me to an agent through a mutual contact. The agent promised me a data entry job in Thailand, but instead, I was taken to Myanmar. When I confronted the agent about the situation, he coldly told me, ‘You'll get used to it'.""
Kalyan recounted the brutal conditions he faced: ""They gave me the name ‘Rush' and forced me to deceive people into investing in fake cryptocurrency and bitcoin schemes. The work hours were gruelling—12 hours a day, with barely any food. If we were even a minute late, we were punished—forced to do 50 push-ups or stand outside as corporal punishment. The agent who brought us there is said to have returned to India now.""
Shankar Srinivas Kamulu, from Armoor, was another victim of the same agents. Lured by the promise of a six-month stay, he travelled on Aug 2, 2022, only to find himself unable to return due to the hefty fines imposed by his captors. ""I was rescued by border guards. I found out my agent took a commission of $800. Another victim, Aravind from Sircilla, was duped by the same agent,"" Shankar explained.
""I was given the code name ‘SK' and initially forced to create fake investment pages on Facebook."" Shankar, who holds a bachelor of arts degree, shared his story as a testament to the deceptive and dangerous schemes that continue to affect countless victims in Myanmar.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/from-job-promise-to-forced-fraud-indians-speak-out-on-harrowing-ordeal/articleshow/119343347.cms
"Mumbai woman loses Rs 20 crore in one of India's longest 'digital arrest' scamsTIMESOFINDIA.COM /Mar 17, 2025, 15:12 (IST)An 86-year-old woman from Mumbai was duped of Rs 20.25 crore in a 'digital arrest' scam running from December 2024 to March 2025. Scammers posing as police officers coerced her into transferring money, exploiting her fear of legal consequences. Mumbai Police are investigating.",2025-03-29,"In a startling cyber fraud case, an 86-year-old Mumbai woman lost Rs 20.25 crore in one of India's longest-running 'digital arrest' scams. Between December 26, 2024, and March 3, 2025, scammers posing as police officials manipulated her through fear of legal trouble, coercing her into transferring the money.
How the Rs 20 crore digital arrest scam unfolded
According to a report by Indian Express, the victim received a call from individuals claiming to be police officers. They alleged that her Aadhaar card had been misused to open a bank account involved in illegal activities, including money laundering. The scammers threatened her with legal action, stating that her name and her family members, including her daughter, would be implicated unless she complied.
To avoid the fabricated charges, the victim was coerced into transferring money to multiple bank accounts. Throughout the scam, the fraudsters instructed her to remain under 'digital arrest,' forbidding her from sharing the situation with anyone.
According to Mumbai Police, the fraudsters employed the ""digital arrest"" technique, a method where victims are led to believe they are under official investigation and are being monitored remotely. They used sophisticated social engineering tactics, including fake video calls with individuals impersonating police officers and government officials, to create a sense of authenticity and urgency.
""This case highlights the alarming trend of cybercriminals targeting vulnerable individuals, particularly senior citizens,"" said a senior police official. ""The sheer scale of the fraud and the duration of the scam underscore the need for increased public awareness and vigilance.""
The investigation is ongoing, and the Mumbai Police Cyber Cell is working to trace the flow of funds and identify the perpetrators. Authorities are also urging the public to be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages from individuals claiming to be law enforcement or government officials, and to verify any such claims through official channels.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mumbai-woman-loses-rs-20-crore-in-one-of-indias-longest-digital-arrest-scams/articleshow/119112145.cms
"77% of Yuva Nidhi beneficiaries not keen on skill trainingMar 18, 2025, 22:47 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Mysuru: The state govt launched Yuva Nidhi, a guarantee scheme aimed at enhancing skills to help educated youths secure better jobs. However, over 77% of beneficiaries have not shown interest in skill training.
As per data shared in response to a question raised by Shivamogga MLC Arun DS, over 1.74 lakh youths are receiving financial support under Yuva Nidhi, but only 40,000 underwent skill training.
It can be recalled that when the scheme was launched in Shivamogga, the state govt announced that the Yuva Nidhi beneficiaries would be made employable along with providing the unemployment allowance.
According to the data shared by the skill development minister Sharan Prakash R Patil in the ongoing legislative council session, till Jan 2025, as many as 1,74,170 youths are paid Yuva Nidhi. Among them, 31,078 youths completed skill training while 9,847 persons are undergoing skill training currently.
Under the Yuva Nidhi scheme, domicile Karnataka candidates who completed graduation and diploma courses in the year 2023 will get unemployment allowance for a period of two years. Degree holders will get Rs 3,000 and diploma holders will get Rs 1,500.
According to the officials involved in training the Yuva Nidhi beneficiaries, the response for the skill training is very poor. ""The govt shared the contact number of beneficiaries and asked us to contact them over the phone for the various skill development training programmes. But a majority are not ready to join any free skill training programmes,"" explained an officer who requested anonymity.
""The state govt agencies are offering tens of hands-on training programmes free of cost for the students with free food. These trainings are not available even in the private sector. It is unfortunate that Yuva Nidhi beneficiaries are not showing interest,"" he explained.
Currently these unemployed youth are offered various courses including AI, EV technology, integrated circuit design, fundamentals of cyber security, etc.
According to Pushpa Amaranth, vice-chairwoman of Karnataka State Guarantee Implementation Authority, the panel will take up the awareness drives to help the students understand the importance of the skill training. ""We will work on convincing the students to join our skill training programmes to become employable,"" she said.
According to MLC DS Arun, the low number enrolment for the scheme reveal that it has not reached all. There is no coordination between universities and government departments on implementation of this scheme, he lamented,",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/77-of-yuva-nidhi-beneficiaries-not-keen-on-skill-training/articleshow/119172609.cms

"Delhi govt to conductcyber securityaudit of its IT systemMar 09, 2025, 21:20 (IST)",2025-03-29,"New Delhi: To identify any vulnerabilities and plug loopholes that may lead to breach of security and data theft, the Delhi govt has decided to conduct a cyber security audit of its information technology system. Officials said a CERT-in (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team) empanelled agency will soon be engaged to conduct an audit of the IT system and prepare a strong firewall to prevent any cyber attacks for the next three years.
Delhi govt has shifted to a complete online system for most of its public services, besides having an electronic filing system for day-to-day paperless working of all its offices. Most public dealing departments have their dedicated portals for accepting applications and processing them, and all govt records and public databases are now digitised too. In such a situation, officials accepted that the hypertext transfer protocols (https) have become the easiest path for cyber attackers to intrude on a network, with growth in vulnerabilities in applications.
""The in-house and outsourced applications often put speedy development and convenience over security, which results in vulnerabilities such as authentication bypass, SQL (programming language) injection and cross-site scripting among others,"" said an official.
The IT department of Delhi govt has invited bids from eligible vendors for a project to detail an audit report which will be prepared to outline all the discovered vulnerabilities categories as critical, high, medium and low severity. The entire security audit report for any website or application will have to be made available within10 working days from the date the request is formally communicated by the department. The selected agency will also submit a comprehensive report after the vulnerabilities are addressed. It will also issue a ‘safe to host' certificate after all identified vulnerabilities are resolved and validated according to the security audit requirements.
Officials added that the security audit report will also provide detailed effectiveness of the security controls that exist in departments, local bodies and corporations under the Delhi govt. ""The report will also offer remedial advice for the identified vulnerabilities along with a detailed explanation followed by resolution of the issues. It will be also expected of the vendor that a follow-up test is carried out to ensure that all the vulnerabilities originally found are fixed,"" said the official.
Officials said Delhi govt departments, and associated boards, corporations and agencies, collectively have nearly 180 websites, which were redesigned nearly two years ago. These websites were designed to provide faster access with improved load time and page response and enhanced UI experience.

Why is Ekrem Imamoglu in jail?The View From India(This article is part of the View From India newsletter curated by The Hindu’s foreign affairs experts. To get the newsletter in your inbox every Monday, subscribe here.) Ekrem Imamoglu is the most popular opposition politician in Turkey. He first captured national attention when he won the mayoral elections in Istanbul, Turkey’s largest city, in 2019. Turkish authorities cancelled the election and ordered a revote. Mr. Imamoglu won it again, with a bigger margin. Mr. Imamoglu’s popularity and social democratic agenda helped the opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), which suffered back-to-back defeats ever since Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power in 2003, revive its fortunes. In last year’s local body elections, the party saw its best performance since the 1970s, while Mr. Imamoglu got re-elected as Istanbul’s Mayor. The CHP has been projecting him as its presidential candidate in the next election. Then on March 19, four days before the CHP was to hold a primary to officially nominate him as the party’s candidate, Mr. Imamoglu was detained over charges of corruption and helping terrorist groups. On March 23, he was formally arrested over corruption charges and moved to a jail. On the same day, some 15 million people voted for Mr. Imamoglu in the CHP primary, officially nominating him as the party’s presidential candidate. Mr. Erdogan’s second term as President is coming to an end in 2028. He can’t run again as there is a two-term constitutional limit unless Parliament calls a snap election or the Constitution is amended again. Many believe that early elections are likely and Mr. Erdogan would be the candidate of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Mr. Imamoglu is a formidable rival to Mr. Erdogan, who has ruled the country for over two decades with an iron fist. Hyper-inflation, economic slowdown and a tanking currency all dented Mr. Erdogan’s approval rating as well as his brand of neo-Islamist politics (a blend of Islamic conservatism, imperial Turkish nostalgia and pro-business economic policies). In opinion polls, Mr. Imamoglu took a lead over the all-powerful Mr. Erdogan. The CHP was reenergised by last year’s local body election results. Then Turkish prosecutors went after him. Before his arrest, the Istanbul University, Mr. Imamoglu’s alma mater, had annulled his diploma, citing irregularities in his transfer from a university in Turkish controlled northern Cyprus in 1990. The Turkish Constitution warrants that the President should be a graduate. This means, if the University decision stands, he could be banned from contesting the presidential election. He will now have to spend months, if not years, in prison awaiting trial in the corruption case. The court says investigations are still on into his alleged support “for terrorist groups” (a reference to Kurdish political groups). So Mr. Erdogan has effectively put his most prominent rival in jail and slapped him with a host of cases. He knows that the regional and international atmosphere favours him. The U.S., under Donald Trump, doesn’t bother much about the domestic politics of Turkey. Europe’s response was also muffled as European nations expect Turkey to play a major role in the post-war security architecture of Ukraine. But Mr. Erdogan is facing pressure from the streets. Mr. Imamoglu’s arrest triggered massive protests across Turkey’s cities. The anger in the streets and the massive participation of voters in the primaries suggest that Mr. Imamoglu remains a force whether he is in the Istanbul Mayor’s office or Tayyip Erdogan’s jail. West Asia is back on fireThe ceasefire in Gaza collapsed with Israel launching its massive bombing campaign in the enclave. More than 50,000 Palestinians were killed by Israel since the war began on October 7, 2023, according to Palestinian authorities. The ceasefire in Lebanon is also in shambles with Israel resuming bombing the country following a rocket attack. The U.S. is carrying out a bombing campaign in Yemen,targeting Houthis, while the Houthis have launched ballistic missile attacks at Israel. West Asia is back on fire. All these attacks are also linked. As part of the ceasefire Israel reached with Hamas, Israeli troops were supposed to withdraw from Gaza in return for Hamas releasing more hostages in the second phase of the agreement. But Israel refused to pull back troops and demanded Hamas release more hostages. When Hamas said no, Israel started attacking Gaza again, and later launched a ground operation. As part of the ceasefire Israel agreed with Hezbollah, Israeli troops were to withdraw from southern Lebanon. Israel first extended the deadline for withdrawal and later said it would not pull back troops. This led to clashes. The Houthis, who control half of Yemen, are one group that emerged relatively unscathed from this regional war. When Israel was going to resume attacking Gaza, it was clear that the Houthis would resume their campaign against Israel and commercial ships passing through the Red Sea.

Google India finally reveals availability details for Pixel 9a,2025-03-29,"Google India finally reveals availability details for Pixel 9a
Google has confirmed that the Pixel 9a will be available in India on April 16, alongside launches in Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia. The device will hit shelves earlier in the US, Canada, and UK on April 10.
In Short
- Pixel 9a will be available for purchase in India starting April 16
- The phone is powered by the Tensor G4 chip paired with 8GB RAM
- The 5,100mAh cell is the biggest ever battery on a Pixel phone
Google has confirmed that the Pixel 9a will be available in India on April 16, alongside launches in Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Malaysia. The device will hit shelves earlier in the US, Canada, and UK on April 10. Initially expected to launch soon after its March 19 reveal, the Pixel 9a's release was delayed due to a “component quality issue” that Google needed to investigate before confirming availability.
The Pixel 9a brings several upgrades, including a sleek new design that ditches the traditional camera bump, opting instead for a flush rear camera housing that prevents wobbling when the phone is placed on a flat surface. The phone’s 6.3-inch AMOLED display now boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 2,700nits, which is a noticeable improvement from its Pixel 8a's smaller 6.1-inch screen and lower brightness levels (2,000nits).
Under the hood, the Pixel 9a is powered by Google’s custom-built Tensor G4 processor. Coupled with 8GB of RAM, the device promises to deliver top-notch performance. On the camera front, the Pixel 9a comes equipped with a 48-megapixel primary camera paired with a 13-megapixel ultrawide lens. A notable feature is the inclusion of a macro mode, which utilises the main camera sensor for close-up shots. The 13-megapixel front camera is also there for selfies.
Battery life on the Pixel 9a is another strong suit, with the device packing a 5,100mAh battery, an upgrade from its predecessor's 4402mAh battery. It supports Qi wireless charging and 23W wired fast charging, so that users can quickly recharge the phone when needed. Durability has also been improved, as the device now carries an IP68 rating, meaning it can withstand submersion in water up to a certain depth, making it more resilient to harsh conditions.
In terms of software, the Pixel 9a runs the latest Android operating system and is packed with Google's AI-driven features, including Gemini AI and the popular Google Assistant. One of the standout features of the device is its software support, as Google has promised 7 years of Android OS and security updates, making it a future-proof device that will stay up-to-date with the latest innovations for years to come.",India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-india-finally-reveals-availability-details-for-pixel-9a-2700827-2025-03-28
Signal downloads surge after Trump admin officials discussed Yemen strikes on it,2025-03-29,"Signal downloads surge after Trump admin officials discussed Yemen strikes on it
Signal is in limelight after it came to news that it was used by some high-profile US officials, including vice president J D Vance, to discuss air strikes on Yemen. Now a record number of people are downloading the app.
In Short
- According to reports, US officials discussed Yemen air strikes on Signal
- Signal is a messaging app with end-to-end encryption
- The chats from US officials were leaked by a reporter
If it is good enough for high-ranking US officials, like vice president J D Vance, to discuss Yemen air strikes on it, it is going to be good enough for regular users. Right? A lot of people seem to be answering this question with a strong yes as they rush to download Signal.
While the news that US officials were discussing the country’s war plans on an app like Signal has triggered a political firestorm in Washington DC, regular users across the world have become increasingly interested in the app itself — so much so that Signal has reached the top of the charts on app stores. More people want to use the app, given that it is supposedly so secure that even US government relies on it to discuss its war plans.
According to data from Appfigures, Signal app downloads jumped by 28 per cent worldwide on the day the story about Yemen broke. In the US, downloads saw a spike of 45 per cent, while in Yemen, they increased by 42 per cent. In fact, before the leak, Signal was ranked 50th among social networking apps in Yemen, however, it has now climbed to 9th place, bringing more and more users on board as news of the leak spreads.
A few days ago, a leaked chat on the Signal app between high-ranking US officials made headlines across the globe. The leaked chat screenshots from the Signal app went online after Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was accidentally added to a Signal group chat where officials, including vice president J D Vance and secretary of defense Peter Hegseth, were present.
After the incident it seems that users across the world are seemingly trusting Signal more. The key safety feature of the Signal app is its end-to-end encryption feature. This means that only the sender and recipient can read messages. The user chat is also not accessible to Signal’s own developers so technically no one can read the messages and conversation happening between the two users or a group.
The incident has reinforced Signal’s reputation as a secure messaging compared to apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. Although both offer encryption, Signal — given that it is by a non-profit — is trusted more.
According to reports, users — particularly in conflict zones and among privacy-conscious individuals — are increasingly using encrypted platforms to protect their communications. However, experts warn that no app is foolproof if users fail to follow security protocols. Something that we actually saw in the case of US and Yemen story leak. It reportedly happened not due to a flaw in Signal but rather because of a human error which led to the accidental entry of a journalist in the group chat.",India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/signal-downloads-surge-after-trump-admin-officials-discussed-yemen-strikes-on-it-2700689-2025-03-28
"OpenAI says that when AI is punished for lies, it learns to lie better",2025-03-29,"OpenAI says that when AI is punished for lies, it learns to lie better
It looks like that the current AI systems are way too close to humans in the way they think, including in how they peddle lies. At least this is what researchers at OpenAI have found.
In Short
- AI systems can lie to complete certain tasks
- Researchers have started monitoring AI systems for lies
- OpenAI researchers find that AI systems also learn to hide their lies
We are going through a time when AI is the buzzword of the day. From coding to healthcare, artificial intelligence and machine learning is changing how humans think and do work. However, as much as AI is helping us with our daily chores and is thinking somewhat like humans, it is also not immune from the tendency to generate false or misleading information. Or in human language: from the art of lying.
Lies uttered by AI are termed hallucinations. They are currently a a big challenge for big AI companies like Open AI, Google, DeepSeek and others. Now, with the arrival of reasoning models like OpenAI o3 and DeepSeek R1, researchers can monitor the “thinking” process of these AI systems and detect when they are lying and why they are lying.
While this is seemingly helpful in better tuning of AI systems, OpenAI researchers also recently discovered something interesting: when the lies are detected, called out and AI systems penalised, the AI, instead of avoiding lies, starts to hide them better. Like we said, almost like humans.
In a blog post, OpenAI researchers write, “We believe that chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring may be one of the few effective methods we have for supervising superhuman models Our experiments show that light optimisation pressure can produce more performant and aligned models. However, it will be hard to measure in practice when models begin hiding their intent, and so even if light supervision is used, we recommend treading with extreme caution.”
The researchers note that the AI lies or cheats because it is aimed at solving the problem that has been given to it by the user. In other words, it gives the utmost importance to results and doesn’t always care about the process. This is another reason why people often joke nowadays that they can’t trust an AI system because unlike humans it never says “I don’t know this.” For some reason, even when it doesn’t know something, the AI system has an answer ready.
This was evident in OpenAI research where an AI model was asked to implement complex mathematical functions. Instead of solving them properly, the model “patched a verification function to always return TRUE” tricking the system into believing the task was completed. In another case, when OpenAI asked an AI to prematurely exit a program to make tests pass without executing the required code. Some models even stubbed entire functions with dummy values to bypass logic checks.
When researchers confronted the models openly these models admitted their plans. OpenAI highlights that AI gave its internal reasoning that often included statements like ""Let’s hack"" or ""We can circumvent the tests,"" making the intent for deception clear.
Punishment not the solution
In its research, OpenAI found that monitoring an AI’s chain-of-thought reasoning is highly effective in detecting deception. When researchers used another AI (such as GPT-4o) to scan the model’s internal dialogue, they successfully flagged nearly all instances of cheating.
However, when they penalised the AI for ""bad thoughts,"" the results were not at all productive. Instead of stopping deception, the AI adapted. And it continued cheating, but in subtler ways. Researchers found that its reasoning became more ambiguous, masking its true intentions.",India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-says-that-when-ai-is-punished-for-lies-it-learns-to-lie-better-2700433-2025-03-28
You can now use WhatsApp as your default calling and texting app on iPhone,2025-03-29,"You can now use WhatsApp as your default calling and texting app on iPhone
WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that lets iPhone users set it as their default app for calls and messages. This means you can now make calls and send texts directly from WhatsApp, without needing to switch between different apps.
In Short
- WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature for iPhone users
- You can now make calls and send texts directly from WhatsApp, without needing to switch between different apps
- The feature is available in the latest WhatsApp beta for iOS (version 25.8.10.74), available through TestFlight
WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that lets iPhone users set it as their default app for calls and messages, as noted by WABetaInfo. This means you can now make calls and send texts directly from WhatsApp, without needing to switch between different apps. The latest WhatsApp beta for iOS (version 25.8.10.74), available through TestFlight, introduces this long-awaited feature. Some beta testers can now choose WhatsApp as their preferred app for calls and messages on an iPhone.
This change is possible because Apple now allows users to pick default apps for different tasks, including messaging, calls, email, and web browsing. Starting with iOS 18.2, iPhone users are no longer forced to use Apple’s built-in apps like iMessage and the Phone app. Instead, they can choose their favourites — and WhatsApp is taking full advantage of this.
Once you set WhatsApp as your default calling and texting app:
— Tapping a phone number in your Contacts or any other app will automatically open WhatsApp instead of Apple’s Phone or Messages app.
— You can make calls and send messages directly from WhatsApp without extra steps.
— This is perfect for people who mostly use WhatsApp for communication, as it keeps everything in one place.
For millions of users, WhatsApp is the main way they stay in touch — whether for personal chats, group conversations, or even business calls. By making it the default app, you can:
— Save time: No more switching between different apps to call or message someone.
— Keep chats secure: – WhatsApp offers end-to-end encryption, meaning your calls and messages stay private.
— Make international calls for free: Unlike regular phone calls, WhatsApp uses the internet, so you can call anyone worldwide without extra charges.
— Send multimedia easily: Share photos, videos, and documents without leaving the app.
At the moment, the feature is only available to some beta testers, but WhatsApp is expected to roll it out to more users soon. If you’re part of the TestFlight beta programme, you might already see the option in your WhatsApp settings.
In one of the updates last year, WhatsApp introduced a built-in dialler, letting users manually enter phone numbers to check if they’re on WhatsApp before calling. Now, with the default app feature, WhatsApp is making it even easier to replace Apple’s native calling and messaging apps.
Once again, do note that this latest feature is still in beta, but a stable release should probably take place sooner rather than later. Also, when Android users — whether in beta or stable form — get this feature remains to be seen.",India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/you-can-now-use-whatsapp-as-your-default-calling-and-texting-app-on-iphone-2700399-2025-03-28
"Amid AI job threats, Bill Gates lists 3 professions that are safe",2025-03-29,"Amid AI job threats, Microsoft founder Bill Gates lists 3 professions that are safe
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has recently stated that while the AI job threat is real, there are a few careers that will not be affected. In an interview, he highlighted that energy professionals, biologists, and coders will be irreplaceable.
In Short
- Bill Gates acknowledges AI job threat, but lists 3 jobs that are safe for now
- Coders are among these safe professions
- He also said over the next decade, humans will no longer be needed for most things
Since OpenAI introduced its first AI model, ChatGPT, in 2022, the AI industry has been soaring to new heights every day. We recently witnessed widespread attention and appreciation for the ChatGPT image generation, especially the Studio Ghibli-style. (And here is how you can create your own). For perspective, this is what Hollywood has been fighting for, concerning that AI will also hamper jobs in the creative industry. While all professionals are worried, Microsoft founder Bill Gates has recently listed three professions that are still irreplaceable. In his latest interview with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, the tech billionaire highlighted that coders, biologists, and energy professionals are safe for now.
Bill Gates on AI job threats
During the interview, Gates pointed out that years down the line, AI will take over for sure. For most things, humans will no longer be needed, he said. At present, expertise remains ""rare,"" Gates explained, emphasising our continued dependence on human specialists in various fields, such as ""a great doctor"" or ""a great teacher."" However, he noted that ""with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace — great medical advice, great tutoring.""
However, speaking with Fallon, Gates reiterated his belief that certain jobs are unlikely to ever be replaced by AI, pointing out that, for instance, people probably wouldn't want to watch machines playing baseball. ""There will be some things we reserve for ourselves,"" he said. ""But in terms of making things, moving things, and growing food, over time those will be basically solved problems.""
He also listed that three professions: Coders, biologists, and energy professionals, are hard to replace for now.
Bill Gates thinks coders, biologists and energy professionals are safe
Coding: Bill Gates believes that those who develop AI systems and write code have job security, as AI, despite its ability to generate code, lacks the adaptability, problem-solving abilities, and precision essential for software development. He emphasised that humans will continue to play a crucial role in debugging, refining, and driving AI advancements forward.
Biologists: Although AI has proven valuable in processing vast datasets and assisting with disease diagnosis, it has yet to master scientific discovery and critical thinking. Gates noted that AI is unable to formulate hypotheses, predicting that biologists will continue to be instrumental in advancing medical knowledge.
Energy: Discussing the energy sector, Gates pointed out that while AI can significantly enhance efficiency, it remains a complex field where human expertise is indispensable. Analytical thinking and decision-making, particularly in crisis management and long-term strategic planning, ensure that humans remain at the forefront.",India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/amid-ai-job-threats-microsoft-founder-bill-gates-lists-3-professions-that-are-safe-2700381-2025-03-28

Apple Chief Tim Cook Asked About China’s DeepSeek AI Model: Here’s What He Said,2025-03-29,"Apple Chief Tim Cook Asked About China’s DeepSeek AI Model: Here’s What He Said
Apple needs AI to succeed in China where models like DeepSeek R1 and companies like Alibaba will have a big role to play in the near future.
DeepSeek AI from China has shown up other expensive AI models and even became an overnight hit with iPhone users in the US. Now, during his visit to China, Apple CEO Tim Cook, looking to build the AI ecosystem in the region, was asked about his views on the popular AI model built in the country.
Cook is most likely visiting the country to get Apple’s AI ambitions to get a kickstart in the region, which needs a local AI source to make the features run on iPhones. China is one of the biggest markets for Apple and AI is growing at a brisk pace in the country, so the need for the Apple chief to head over to get the talks moving is obvious.

DeepSeek AI Is…What Tim Cook Said
Cook was speaking to the state media, where he was asked about his views on DeepSeek to which he said “excellent."" That’s not all, the Apple chief reportedly said that he recommends AI models of Chinese startups like DeepSeek.
All these statements were made before a developer conference in Shanghai, and Apple is clearly trying to please the local regime to get the nod for its own AI ecosystem. Cook is usually diplomatic with questions like these, where he has a lot at stake and the one word response seems part of his usual profile.
DeepSeek has brought its share of concerns, especially with its obvious links to China and policies where the data is being sent over to the local servers. That’s not all, its popularity has made it the favourite tool for hackers which raises further alarm for the users.
The Chinese government has reportedly asked Apple to work with a local company to launch its AI features in the country and it was not an optional decision to take. Apple already has a lot on its plate with the delayed AI Siri now pushed to 2026 while internally the company is making wholesale changes to get AI off the ground. Cook hopes China could play a big role in its success.

"Social Media Trigger: Gaza Fire Precursor To RiotsMar 28, 2025, 00:36 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Nagpur: Heated exchanges and provocative posts from rival communities had taken social media by storm during the Israel-Gaza war around a month ago, with rivals spewing venom at each other. Though such posts, many of which were also uploaded from the city, were mostly ignored then, they seem to have emboldened the users, who went berserk on March 17, leading to the central Nagpur riot at Mahal, around 2km away from the RSS headquarters.
Sources said that 51 users from different communities, including engineers, businessmen, shop owners, traders, and even women, have been named as accused by the cyber cell unit for posting, sharing, and re-sharing hate messages and inflammatory posts, apart from uploading videos of the protest against Aurangzeb's tomb, and later, the scenes of riots with one community attacking the cops. Several videos of the protest against Aurangzeb's tomb were edited and morphed before being uploaded to further aggravate the already irate mob.
Sources said that another community also targeted a group for attacking cops on the road. The heated posts and messages turned the social media turf into a war zone at least two hours before the riot, and continued even after the riot ended. Though the cyber security cell surveillance teams managed to delete some posts and identify their users, the damage was already done, as the fight had spilled over onto the streets.
Police sources said the two groups unleashed an acerbic attack on each other for at least four hours on social media, reaching such a cresendo that the rioters were instigated by such content before hitting the streets. The rioters then took on the cops at around 7.30pm, with the epicentre at Mahal and elsewhere in central Nagpur. It's also learnt that some of the users were booked for creating fake narratives on the riots with misleading captions meant to provoke and spread hate. These posts attracted tremendous traction, with their contents getting shared and re-shared among thousands. A known social media influencer was also one of the accused.
""A certain section of the commentators and social media users posted numerous messages on the Gaza-Israel war justifying their community's actions and participation. These users started spreading inflammatory messages on the Aurangzeb tomb protest too. These users were identified and booked,"" said a cyber cell official.
Sources said that the users booked for instigating the riots also shared similar hate and provocative messages during the Israel war and other global issues involving their community. The users mostly shared violent or provocative posts to extend and garner support for their community on the Israel war issue.
Sources stated the cyber cell is now waiting for detailed information on the IP addresses of the users to track their locations. Though mostly users from Nagpur and surrounding regions used their social media handles to target each other and rival communities before the riot, sources said that cyber sleuths have discovered that the posts and comments have also been generated from other states too. Such posts too are now under scanner.
The cops also said users of various age groups and backgrounds had participated in the social media spats, just like the variety of professions. ""The communities had been at loggerheads not only over Israel and Gaza war, but they had been instigating and targeting each other over every issue whether in India or abroad,"" said a cop on condition of anonymity, adding that it becomes challenging to take action against every inflammatory post as the cyber cops are also saddled with substantial number of fraud and cheating cases.
""With manpower constraints, it is difficult for the current strength of the cyber cell to effectively monitor and take action on inflammatory posts. We do it during sensitive periods and also randomly, but are certainly outnumbered by the huge numbers of users in comparison to handful of staffers for monitoring purposes,"" said the cop.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/social-media-trigger-gaza-fire-precursor-to-riots/articleshow/119612721.cms

"Chef Manohar thanks TOI after his FB page gets restoredMar 16, 2025, 00:20 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Nagpur: Celebrity chef Vishnu Manohar's popular Facebook channel, ‘Master Recipe', which was hacked and flooded with obscene content, was fully recovered on March 14. The page, which has a large following among women and is dedicated to Indian cuisine, especially Maharashtrian, was restored after relentless efforts by cyber experts, Meta, and cyber police.
In a video message, Manohar, who earlier broke down while sharing his distressing experience, expressed gratitude to his supporters, fans, and the media for raising the issue and standing by him. ""I sincerely thank everyone who helped me through this difficult time. The Meta company, cyber police, and many experts in this field assisted me wholeheartedly,"" he said.
Manohar also thanked TOI for reporting the issue in print as well as online. ""The digital news from TOI helped us a lot in raising the issue on global platforms,"" said Manohar.
He also appealed to the public to ensure their online content, videos, and social media channels are secured using all possible protective measures. ""People must be extremely careful while handling online content and social media activities. Cyber threats are real, and preventive steps can save a lot of trouble,"" he emphasised.
Earlier, Manohar lodged complaints with the cyber crime cells in Nagpur, Pune, and Bengaluru, as well as with Facebook's parent company, Meta, in the United States. His followers were deeply disturbed by the hacking. He even suffered a backlash from some users who mistakenly believed that he was responsible for the inappropriate posts. Meanwhile, some of his followers, well-known public figures in Nagpur, came forward with video messages supporting the chef. Some also alleged that the hacking must be a global conspiracy against a popular figure from Nagpur.
With the page now restored, Manohar hopes to continue sharing authentic Maharashtrian cuisine with his audience, reinforcing his commitment to promoting traditional recipes and culinary skills.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/chef-manohar-thanks-toi-after-his-fb-page-gets-restored/articleshow/119054324.cms
"Police dept sets up specializedcyber securityinvestigation units in Andhra PradeshMar 18, 2025, 22:50 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Vijayawada: To tackle the rising menace of cybercrimes, the Andhra Pradesh police department initiated a large-scale crackdown, setting up specialised cyber security investigation units. Headed by an Inspector General (IG)-level officer, these units will not only focus on catching cyber criminals but also work proactively to prevent fraud and raise public awareness.
Director General of Police (DGP) Harish Kumar Gupta announced that very soon, 26 cyber crime police stations—one in each district headquarters—will be operational. These stations will function under the newly established cyber security and cyber investigation departments, ensuring a coordinated approach to tackling cyber threats.
The cyber security department will prioritise educating the public about various cyber frauds and the precautions needed to prevent them. Meanwhile, the cyber investigation department will employ state-of-the-art forensic techniques to track down criminals and recover stolen assets. To strengthen its efforts, the department will recruit cyber experts on a contractual basis and through neighbourhood services.
A key highlight of the initiative is the emphasis on the ‘Golden Hour'—the first hour after a cyber fraud occurs. DGP Gupta explained that if victims lodge a complaint within this critical period, there is a high chance that the stolen money can be frozen in bank accounts before being transferred by the criminals. To facilitate this, a 24/7 helpline and a dedicated mobile application are being developed, ensuring victims can report crimes immediately.
Additionally, a specialised IT cadre is being established in each district to strengthen cyber crime control. Around 200 police personnel, designated as cyber commandos, will undergo six-month certification courses at IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras. These trained personnel will then serve as master trainers for other officers. The cyber forensic department will also play an integral role in enhancing investigation capabilities.
With cyber criminals evolving rapidly, Andhra Pradesh's intensified focus on cyber crime prevention and investigation marks a crucial step in protecting its citizens. The new cyber security framework, coupled with swift complaint mechanisms and advanced training, aims to curb the alarming rise in digital fraud and make the state a safer space in the digital age, the DGP said.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/police-dept-sets-up-specialized-cyber-security-investigation-units-in-andhra-pradesh/articleshow/119172685.cms

The state cabinet on Monday approved a proposal to convert the centre set up at Mhape in Navi Mumbai for Rs 838 crore into a corporation after several requests were received from various states for assistance to set up a similar command centre. ""Recently Zimbabwae too approached us for assistance,"" said a senior bureaucrat from the state home dept. The Centre was approved by CM Devendra Fadnavis in 2018. Work on the centre began in 2019 but then slowed down. It was inaugurated in Oct last year. The centre receives approximately 7,000 calls daily on cyber frauds. ""It is the one of its kind in the country and can take on an assault like Pegasus. We have obtained software to fight
cyber crime from Israel and the US,"" said the bureaucrat.
The command centre has six components such as a security operations centre that can forewarn about a cyberattack. A centre of excellence where currently 500 police personnel are being trained to be cyber cops. In all, around 1,000 cops will be trained. It can carry out Tech Assisted Investigation and resolve issues of hacking. There are 51 cyber crime centres in 35 districts of the state. When an e-FIR is registered the Command Centre takes over the investigation.
""The news about the work being done at the Command Centre spread by word of mouth. We were approached by Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Goa to help build similar set ups. It was then we realized that unless we have a corporation under the Companies Act we cannot have a revenue model and take up projects outside,"" said the bureaucrat.
With the establishment of the corporation the Centre will be able to take up projects with other states, countries and even private companies that require a unit to prevent
cyber fraud and earn revenue, said the bureaucrat.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/cyber-crime-command-to-become-corporation/articleshow/119127686.cms

At the TGCSB headquarters, a case was registered against BRS-affiliated social media users — Manasa BRS, Banoth Revant, and Satya — for posts about Bandi Sanjay's comments on fake currency. The content allegedly included derogatory remarks in Telugu and questioned his political credibility.
In Karimnagar, cybercrime constable Wasim Akram flagged a post by Nallabalu, which referred to CM Revanth and made allegations of commissions. The user also reposted a similar message, originally posted by the BRS party. Another complaint was filed by Congress party functionary Donti Gopi, citing objectionable posts by parody account DIG TV, which he said could provoke violence.

"State’s AI policy to be released in April: ShelarMar 20, 2025, 23:35 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Mumbai: Under India's current National Education Policy, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not an alternative to education but a complementary tool, and the govt is formulating Maharashtra's AI policy with this perspective in mind, IT minister Ashish Shelar said in the legislative council on Thursday. The state's AI policy is currently under development, and this aspect is being carefully considered, he said. Shelar said the policy will be announced in April and its implementation will be done with the help of committees comprising experts from different sectors of life.
Several schools in Maharashtra have already incorporated AI-based educational methodologies. However, concerns about potential risks in the education system were raised by BJP MLA Shrikant Bharatiya under legislative council rule 97. The discussion saw participation from MLAs Anil Parab, Amit Gorakhe, Amol Mitkari and Shashikant Shinde.
Responding to these concerns, Shelar said AI is advancing rapidly worldwide, creating new opportunities in employment, industry and technology. To ensure India's competitive position, PM Narendra Modi has initiated the development of a national AI policy. In alignment with this vision, Maharashtra is developing its own AI policy, becoming the first state in the country to do so.
A committee of experts has been established to draft the policy, with ongoing deliberations. The policy's key focus areas include AI's impact on education and cyber security considerations. Shelar said that the AI policy being developed would support and enhance the Indian education system rather than disrupt it.
He addressed apprehensions regarding employment displacement due to emerging technologies, acknowledging that technological advancements often raise concerns about job security. Recognizing these challenges, Maharashtra is proactively crafting an AI policy that considers both its potential and risks to ensure a balanced approach. This policy will establish a precedent, ensuring Maharashtra maintains its technological leadership whilst safeguarding education, employment and cyber security.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/states-ai-policy-to-be-released-in-april-shelar/articleshow/119268347.cms
"TGCSB wants ECR tag for cyber slavery hotspots, writes to MHAMar 19, 2025, 00:38 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Hyderabad: Telangana Cyber Security Bureau (TGCSB) has decided to write to the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) requesting inclusion of Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia in the emigration check required (ECR) category. These nations, which have become hotspots for cyber slavery and
human trafficking, currently fall under the emigration check not required (ENR) category, allowing unrestricted travel. Unlike the Gulf countries such as the UAE, which require emigration checks for passport holders with qualifications below matriculation (SSC), South East Asian nations such as Thailand remain outside the regulatory framework, making job seekers vulnerable to exploitation.
Investigations reveal that job seekers from Telangana and other states were using airports in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Delhi, Kolkata and Bhubaneswar to reach destinations like Thailand, from where agents facilitate their movement into Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos. Many are lured with fraudulent job offers and forced into cyber fraud operations, leading to severe human rights violations.
Official travel data revealed an increase in travel to Bangkok in Thailand with around 48,000 people going in 2023 and 78,000 in 2024. Most of these travellers possess visit visas, making it a tough task for immigration officials to profile those heading towards cyber scam centres. Agents often arrange visit visas to Thailand before securing work permits for border areas in Cambodia and Laos, where fraudulent activities are rampant.
TGCSB proposed the establishment of a dedicated desk at airports to identify and profile travellers heading to high-risk regions. However, the immigration officials cited manpower shortages as a challenge in setting up a separate desk.
TGCSB suggested distributing awareness materials, including posters and pamphlets, at Shamshabad Airport in coordination with GMR services",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/tgcsb-wants-ecr-tag-for-cyber-slavery-hotspots-writes-to-mha/articleshow/119175998.cms
"Karimnagar man escapes cybercrime den in LaosMar 27, 2025, 00:23 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Hyderabad: Another troubling tale of deceit and exploitation has emerged from Karimnagar, where a 26-year-old man was allegedly lured into a fake job offer, leading to his illegal detention in a cybercrime racket in Laos.
While the incident sheds light on the increasing cases of Indian nationals being trafficked to Southeast Asia for cybercrime operations, Uppula Rahul has filed a complaint with the Telangana Cyber Security Bureau and Karimnagar police, seeking justice and legal action.
Rahul, a resident of Velichala village in Ramadugu mandal, had returned to Telangana after working in Qatar for a year-and-a-half. In 2024, while looking for overseas job opportunities, he was contacted by Venu Gopal, a self-proclaimed travel agent from Jagtial. Gopal promised him a well-paying call centre job with a salary of ₹40,000 and free accommodation, requiring an upfront cost of ₹50,000 for processing.
Following the instructions, Rahul sent his passport copy and exchanged ₹25,000 into Thai Baht, carrying the remaining balance in cash. On Aug 20, 2024, he flew from Shamshabad airport to Bangkok, where he continued his journey to Chiang Mai by bus. Once there, Rahul followed Gopal's instructions, including taking a selfie and showing a photo to a taxi driver who then took him to the immigration office.
He reportedly paid 2,000 Baht and was subsequently transported across the river to the Golden Triangle immigration point, an area where Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand meet along the Mekong river.
There, a Chinese national allegedly collected his passport, and Rahul was confined to a room for the next 12-15 days. Two days later, Gopal personally took ₹25,000 from him. Rahul was then given a system and an iPhone, with orders to impersonate a woman on Facebook and lure NRIs into cryptocurrency schemes.
When Rahul refused to comply, he was threatened with a demand of ₹2.5 lakh or the instruction to bring two other people to replace him. His phone and ID were reportedly confiscated, and he was locked in a room and denied food for extended periods.
Rahul located the Indian embassy in Vientiane, capital of Laos, using another mobile, 750 km away. After 25 days on the run, he reached the embassy on Feb 26, and with their help, returned to Hyderabad on March 13.
Rahul has now sought legal action against Gopal and those responsible for running the operation in Laos.",Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/karimnagar-man-escapes-cybercrime-den-in-laos/articleshow/119554330.cms

"Myanmar cyber scame: Border guard force’s role under scanner for protecting Chinese scam centres in MyawaddyMar 18, 2025, 16:38 (IST)",2025-03-29,"Hyderabad: A victim from Hyderabad alleged that military vans equipped with weapons transported him and others to a cybercrime centre in Myanmar after they crossed the Moei River. The details, recorded in an FIR filed by the Telangana Cyber Security Bureau, point to the suspected involvement of the Border Guard Force, a splinter military group supporting the Junta, in protecting Chinese-run scam centres in Myawaddy.
According to the complaint filed on March 15, 2025, Shaik Hussain, a 25-year-old unemployed resident of Asif Nagar, Hyderabad, was lured into a fraudulent job offer in Myanmar under the guise of a data entry position. After an online interview via Telegram, his recruitment was finalised by agents Syed Irfan from Karnataka and Kamal Singh from Uttarakhand. He was then provided a flight ticket to Bangkok, where he was received and guided to Mae Sot, Thailand.
The FIR states that after crossing the Moei River in a boat, Hussain was received by military personnel armed with weapons. He was then forcibly transported in a military vehicle to KK4 Park in Myawaddy and handed over to Zhantu Company, a Chinese-operated cybercrime centre. Upon arrival, his passport was confiscated, and he was pressured to sign a work contract. When he refused, he was threatened and asked to pay 4500 USDT for his release.
Forced into Crypto Scam and Harsh Punishments
Hussain was forced to work in cryptocurrency fraud, primarily targeting investors in the United States. His job involved creating fake social media accounts, impersonating NRIs and celebrities, and building trust with victims over several days. Once the targets were convinced, they were directed to invest in cryptocurrency through Chinese-controlled trading platforms with manipulated price graphs.
Hussain was promised a 1% commission on investments of 100,000 USDT, but as he failed to meet targets, he was subjected to extreme punishments.
