# Cybersecurity-News-WebScraper
India Cybersecurity News Intelligence Platform
# Project Overview
Your Replit project is a comprehensive cybersecurity news intelligence platform specifically focused on Indian cybersecurity news sources. The application aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes security news with a special emphasis on government and authoritative sources.

# Architecture & Core Components
1. Web Scraping System
scraper.py: Contains specialized scrapers for multiple Indian news sources with priority given to government sources:
Government Sources: CERT-In, NCIIPC, I4C, NASSCOM
Media Sources: Times of India, The Hindu, India Today, Inc42, Economic Times, Indian Express, News18
Techniques:
Multiple fallback strategies per source for resilient scraping
HTTP request handling with retries and error management
Structured content extraction using Trafilatura and BeautifulSoup
Date extraction and normalization from various formats
2. Data Processing Layer
data_processor.py: Handles all NLP and data analysis tasks:
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Keyword extraction and frequency analysis
Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
Attack type categorization
Industry sector identification
Vulnerability mention extraction
3. Visualization Engine
visualizer.py: Creates interactive data visualizations:
Source distribution charts
Time-based trend analysis
Sentiment analysis visualizations
Keyword distribution
Attack type distribution charts
4. Alert System
alert_system.py: Advanced security alert mechanism:
Severity-based keyword classification (high, medium, low)
Source prioritization (government vs. media)
SMS notification system via Twilio integration
Alert history tracking to prevent duplicates
Two alert modes: individual alerts and digest summaries
Criticality scoring system for ranking security news
5. User Interface
app.py: Streamlit-based web interface with:
Data loading and scraping controls
Interactive filtering and search
Multi-tab visualization dashboard
Critical security alert section with SMS registration
Detailed article view
Key Features
Source Prioritization: Emphasis on authoritative government cybersecurity sources (CERT-In, NCIIPC, I4C, NASSCOM)
